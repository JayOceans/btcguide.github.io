#### Trezor Bridge Warning
Default usage leaks your xpub to Trezor's servers (and whoever they share records with).
This is [estimated at 99% of their users](https://coldbit.com/how-to-use-a-trezor-without-leaking-your-balance-and-transaction-history-to-third-parties/).
This has severe privacy implications and some [potential security implications](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5csles/what_are_the_security_risks_of_sharing_xpub/).
A simple solution is to initialize your Trezor with the Trezor Manager app (android) & use it with Specter/Core.
The CLI solution, linked above, enables more options.

#### Limited BIP174 Support

You can track Trezor's progress on this issue [here](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/49).

Trezor's Model T [does not use the built-in SD card for transacting](https://www.hardware-wallets.net/faq/what-is-the-sd-card-slot-on-the-trezor-model-t-for/).

#### No Keyboard
With only 2 buttons, it's very hard to enter a 24-word seed or strong passphrase.
You can read about advanced recovery steps on the screen for both Trezor One [here](https://blog.trezor.io/using-advanced-recovery-on-trezor-4af0eb53c3bb) and for the Model T [here](https://blog.trezor.io/learn-about-trezor-recovery-seed-offline-backup-fe235873c69f).

To mitigate this, Trezor can plug into your computer and use clever tricks to "securely" enter text on your computer, but is not ideal from a security/UX perspective.

#### No Physical Security
If a clever attacker with ~$100 USD of equipment gains *physical* access to your Trezor (model T or Trezor One) they can extract your seed.
You can read more about this [here](https://donjon.ledger.com/Unfixable-Key-Extraction-Attack-on-Trezor/) and [here](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/) (Trezor's response [here](https://blog.trezor.io/our-response-to-ledgers-mitbitcoinexpo-findings-194f1b0a97d4)).

These attacks can be mitigated with a strong passphrase, and cannot be exploited remotely (must have physical access to your Trezor).

Trezor does have [a bitcoin-only firmware](https://shop.trezor.io/btc-only/), though [this is not a perfect solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/dccdxq/bitcoinonly_firmware_available/).
TODO: find better explainer link.

#### Slow To Sign Multisig Transactions
It is unclear why this is the case:

#### Have Made Breaking Changes in the Past
In June 2020, [BTCPay users found they were no longer able to access their funds](https://twitter.com/BtcpayServer/status/1268544252247715849).
Recovery is possible; savvy users can refuse to upgrade their firmware (and forego potentially valuable security updates) in the first place and expert users can load in their own firmware.
You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/1044).
